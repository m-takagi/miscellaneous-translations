<h2><a id="h-1" />はじめに</h2>
<p>夜更かしっていうのは、世間に反発する若者なら誰でもやりそうなこと。きっと世界中どこでもそうでしょう。薄明かりの中で本を読むとかテレビの深夜放送を見るとか、あとはIRCに入り浸ってお気に入りのオープンソースプロジェクトのちょっとした問題に取り組んだりとか。</p>

<h2><a id="h-2" />そもそものはじまり</h2>
<p>私の場合も、それがすべてのはじまりでした。まずは簡単に自己紹介させてください。私がはじめて地元のLinuxユーザーグループに参加したのは、修士号を取るべく休職して勉強してるときでした。その後間もなく、いくつかのローカライズプロジェクトに参加するようになって、主にデスクトップインターフェイスの翻訳にかかわることになりました。当時使っていたのは、カスタマイズしたエディタとそれに組み込みの書法、そして組み込みのフォントでした。レンダリングエンジンが未熟だったので原稿をうまく表示できないこともあったけど、そんな環境で翻訳し続けました。当時力を入れていたのは、翻訳のワークフローを確立すること。翻訳対象のコンテンツを手に入れて、自分でできる限りの翻訳をし、レビューアに見てもらうためにちょっとしたコメントを追加して自分の考えを残し、著作権や作者などの必須情報を埋めてから原稿を渡す。そんな感じでした。</p>

<h2><a id="h-3" />How it was done</h2>
<p>It was mostly a simple way of doing things. But most importantly it was <i>my</i> independent way of doing things. I took my own time to schedule when I would work on the translations. These would then be reviewed and returned to me for changes. Again, I would schedule them for completion as per how I could squeeze out some time from all the studying and other work that I was doing. When I did get down to work, I would sit through 9-10 straight hours mostly into the wee hours of the morning, feeling a high of accomplishment until the next assignments came through.</p>

<h2><a id="h-4" />What mattered</h2>
<p>What I did not know was that I played a significant part in the larger scheme of things. Namely, release schedules. So, when I completed my 2 cents of the task and sent them over, I did not factor in a situation where they could be rendered useless because they were too late for the current release and too early for the next release (which would invariably contain a lot of changes that would require a rework). Besides these, I was oblivious to the fact how it all mattered to the entire release process -- integration, packaging, interface testing, bug filing, resolution.</p>

<h2><a id="h-5" />How it made me grow up</h2>
<p>All these changed drastically when I moved into a more professional role. So suddenly I was doing the same thing but in a more structured order. I learned that the cavalier road-rolling that I had been used to, was not scalable when one had to juggle through 2-3 release schedules. It had to be meticulously planned to map with the project roadmaps. While working on translating a desktop interface, one had to check what the translation schedule was for the main project. The projected date to start working would be right after when all the original interface messages had been frozen. Translators could then work unhindered until the translation deadline, after which they would be marked as stable in the main repositories and eventually packages would be built. Along with these schedules, a couple of operating system distributions would align their schedules as well. So the translators had the additional responsibility of making sure that the pre-release versions of the operating system that would be carrying the desktop, went through with some bits of testing to ensure that the translations made sense on the interface and did not contain errors.</p>

<h2><a id="h-6" />What I should have known</h2>
<p>The transition was not easy. Suddenly there was a flood of information that I had to deal with and additional chores that I had to perform. From being a hobby and more importantly a stress-buster, suddenly it was serious business. Thinking in retrospect, I can say that it probably helped me understand the entire process because I had to learn it from the ground up. And armed with that knowledge I can analyze situations with a better understanding of all the effective facets. At the time when I started working on the Open Source project(s) of my interest, there were much fewer professionals who worked full time in this domain. Most of the volunteer contributors held day jobs elsewhere and saw these projects as a way to nurture the creative juices that had dried up in their routine tasks. So a number of newcomers were never mentored about how to plan out their projects professionally. They grew to be wonderfully skilled in what they were doing and eventually figured out how they would like to balance their work with the rest of the things they were doing.</p>

<h2><a id="h-7" />Conclusion</h2>
<p>These days I mentor newcomers and one of the first things that I let them know is how and in which part of the project they matter. Crafting an individual style of work is essential as it allows a person a comfortable space to work in, but an understanding of the organized structure that is affected by their work imbibes the discipline that is required to hold in check chances of arbitrary caprice.</p>
