#@# When I rant on at my colleagues about the evils of @<href>{http://martinfowler.com/bliki/Slideument.html, Slideuments}, I do hear a useful push-back. Many people now like to communicate through slide decks that aren't meant to be used for presentations, just to be read. People like me can snark about managers these days being unable to read anything that doesn't look like a bullet point, but there are advantage to these infodecks.
同僚に向かって@<href>{http://martinfowler.com/bliki/Slideument.html, Slideuments}がいかにひどいものかを力説しているときに、有用な反論を聞いた。
多くの人にとって、スライドはもはやプレゼンテーションで使うものではなく単なる読み物なのだ、と。
我々は「マネージャーって奴らは箇条書きのスライドしか読めないんだから」と皮肉ることがあるが、
その手のスライドにもこんな利点がある。

#@# * You can use spatial layout to help explanation
 * 空間を生かしたレイアウトで意味が伝わりやすくなる
#@# * They discourage long prose that people don't read
 * 誰も読まないような長文を書きにくくする
#@# * It's easy to include diagrams as primary elements in the communication
 * コミュニケーションの主要素として、図表を取り入れやすい

#@# All this can lead to a document that's more approachable and easier to communicate information than a traditional prose text would be.
これらすべては、ドキュメントをより親しみやすくかつ伝わりやすくすることにつながる。
昔ながらの長文のテキストに比べて、親しみやすさも伝わりやすさもずっと改善されるだろう。

#@# If a deck is intended for reading and not for projection, then I don't count it as a slideument. Slideuments are bad because they try to do two different things, but an infodeck is there only for reading, so can be done well. Often, of course, they aren't but that's a problem in the execution rather than the fundamental concept.
もしそのスライドが読み物として作られていてプレゼンで投影することを想定していないのなら、
私はそれをもはやSlideumentだとは見なさない。
Slideumentがなぜまずいのかというと、それは二つのことを同時にやろうとしているからだ。
Infodeckの場合は読ませることに専念しているわけであり、それはうまくいくだろう。
もちろん、読ませようとして失敗していることもある。しかしそれは作り方の問題であり、その概念が悪かったわけではない。

Infodecks are an interesting form to me, if only because it seems nobody takes them seriously. Most users look at them as something they just knock up with PowerPoint, and writers with pretentions to seriousness (such as myself) consider infodecks to be beneath us. I'm begining to think we should take them more seriously. We should think and talk more about how to make them effective as communciation vehicles.

One reason that these are likely to grow is that increasingly we are communciating on computer devices and not using paper. Modern computers have bright multi-color screens, and aren't worried about conserving paper. So a colorful, diagram-heavy approach that uses lots of virtual pages is an effective form of document - especially as tablets become more prevalent.

So what makes a good infodeck? Here's a few of my preliminary thoughts.

 * Although they are usually created with a presentation tool, such as PowerPoint or Keynote, they don't have to be. A page-layout style tool is often a better choice. An example of this is the Mac's Pages application. It's page-layout mode works very well for infodecks.
 * Landscape orientation is probably best, if only because they are often read on laptops.
 * Although bullets are the most common forms of using text, stretch out and write short paragraphs. That will convey more information without being too much text. There's no need to limit yourself to bullets if the deck isn't going to be projected.
 * Use diagrams as much as possible and make them the central element of the page with text around them. If you can't think of diagram try laying out the blocks of text with positioning and connecting lines to suggest any interrelationships between them.
 * Use PDF to send info decks around to others. PDF is the best document format for format-intensive documents like infodecks. (ePub is better for prose documents.)
