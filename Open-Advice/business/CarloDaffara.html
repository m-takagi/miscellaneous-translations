<h2><a id="h-1"></a>はじめに</h2>
<p>ほんの数年前までは、``フリーソフトウェアでいったいどうやってお金を稼ぐんだい？''っていうのが定番の質問だった。それが今や``FLOSSを使ってビジネスを成功させるには、どんな戦略で進めればいいんだろう？''に変わってきた。この問いは、そんなに根拠のないものでもない。学術研究者たちも、いまだにこんな文章を書いているくらいだ。``オープンソースソフトウェアは、市場原理とは別の世界で開発されている……商用ソフトウェアのマーケットのように、その開発で何かの価値を生み出しているわけではなく……利益や収入、就職や納税につながったりすることもない……ソフトウェアにオープンソースライセンスを設定する狙いは、誰かがそのソフトウェアの所有権を主張して、そのソフトウェアに価格を設定するのを防ぐことにある。結局のところ、開発したソフトウェアから利益を生み出すことなどできない''[Koot 03]や[Eng 10]はこう言う。``エコノミストが示したところによると、現実世界でのオープンソースの共同作業は、教育や認知そして評判などのさまざまなインセンティブに基づいているものだ''（ここで、金銭的なインセンティブに触れていないことに注意）。FLOSSに対する、この手の ``社会的な'' 視点にはバイアスがかかっており、間違っている。ここでは、フリー／オープンソースビジネスの成功につながる経済的な理由を示す。純粋な無償奉仕の先を行くものだ。</p>

<h2><a id="h-2"></a>FLOSS and Economic Realities</h2>
<p>大半の分野で、FLOSSの採用は経済的に大きなメリットをもたらす。開発やメンテナンスのコストを共有できるからで、Goshのような研究者も指摘するとおり、R&amp;Dのコストを平均で36%ほど削減できると言われている。FLOSSの``内部``開発のシェアが大きいので、その経済的なメリットの一部はビジネススサービス市場においてあまり気づかれていない。</p>
<p>The FLOSSIMPACT study found in 2006 that companies contributing code to FLOSS projects have in total at least 570 thousand employees and an annual revenue of 263B Euro [Gosh 06], thus making Open Source and Free Software among the most important ICT-based economic phenomenons. It is also important to recognize that a substantial percentage of this economic value is not immediately visible in the marketplace, as the majority of software is not developed with the intent of selling it (the so-called ``shrinkwrap'' software) but is developed for internal use only. As identified by the FISTERA EU thematic network in fact the majority of software is developed for internal use only:</p>
<div id="tbl1" class="table">
<table>
<tr><th>Region</th><th>Proprietary software licenses</th><th>Software services (development/customization)</th><th>Internal development</th></tr>
<tr><td>EU-15</td><td>19%</td><td>52%</td><td>29%</td></tr>
<tr><td>US</td><td>16%</td><td>41%</td><td>43%</td></tr>
<tr><td>Japan</td><td>N/A</td><td>N/A</td><td>32%</td></tr>
</table>
</div>
<p>It is clear that what we call ``the software market'' is in reality much smaller than the real market for software and services, and that 80% of it is invisible. We will see that FLOSS has a major part of the economic market directly through this ``internal'' development model.</p>

<h2><a id="h-3"></a>Business Models and Value Proposition</h2>
<p>The basic idea behind business models is quite simple: I have something or can do something -- the ``value proposition'' -- and it is more economical to pay me to do or get this ``something'' instead of doing it yourself (sometimes it may even be impossible to find alternatives, as in natural or man-made monopolies, so the idea of doing it myself may not be applicable). There are two possible sources for the value: a property (something that can be transferred) and efficiency (something that is inherent in what the company does, and how they do it). With Open Source, usually ``property'' is non-exclusive (with the exception of what is called ``Open Core'', where some part of the code is not open at all, and that will be covered later in the article). Other examples of property are trademarks, patents, licenses ... anything that may be transferred to another entity through a contract or legal transaction. Efficiency is the ability to perform an action with a lower cost (both tangible and intangible), and is something that follows the specialization in a work area or appears thanks to a new technology. Examples of the first are simply the decrease in time necessary to perform an action when you increase your expertise in it; the first time you install a complex system it may require a lot of effort, and this effort is reduced the more experience you have with the tasks necessary to perform the installation itself; examples of the second may be the introduction of a tool that simplifies the process (for example, through image cloning) and it introduces a huge discontinuity, a ``jump'' in the graph of efficiency versus time.</p>
<p>These two aspects are the basis of all the business models that we have analyzed in the past; it is possible to show that all of them fall in a continuum between properties and efficiency.</p>
<p>Among the results of our past research project, one thing that we found is that property-based projects tend to have lower contributions from the outside, because it requires a legal transaction to become part of the company's properties; think for example about dual licensing: for his code to become part of the product source code, an external contributor needs to sign off his rights to the code, to allow the company to sell the enterprise version alongside the open one.</p>
<p>On the other hand, right-handed models based purely on efficiency tends to have higher contributions and visibility, but lower monetization rates. As I wrote many times, there is no ideal business model, but a spectrum of possible models, and companies should adapt themselves to changing market conditions and adapt their model as well. Some companies start as pure efficiency based, and build an internal property with time; some others may start as property based, and move to the other side to increase contributions and reduce the engineering effort (or enlarge the user base, to create alternative ways of monetizing users).</p>

<h2><a id="h-4"></a>A Business Models Taxonomy</h2>
<p>The EU FLOSSMETRICS study on Free Software-based business models created, after an analysis of more than 200 companies, a taxonomy of the main business models used by Open Source companies; the main models identified in the market are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dual licensing: the same software code distributed under the GPL and a proprietary license. This model is mainly used by producers of developer-oriented tools and software, and works thanks to the strong coupling clause of the GPL, that requires derivative works or software directly linked to be covered under the same license. Companies not willing to release their own software under the GPL can obtain a proprietary license that provides an exemption from the distribution conditions of the GPL, which seems desirable to some parties. The downside of dual licensing is that external contributors must accept the same licensing regime, and this has been shown to reduce the volume of external contributions, which are limited mainly to bug fixes and small additions.</li>
<li>Open Core (previously called ``proprietary value-add'' or ``split Free Software/proprietary''): this model distinguishes between a basic Free Software and a proprietary version, based on the Free Software one but with the addition of proprietary plug-ins. Most companies following such a model adopt the Mozilla Public License, as it allows explicitly this form of intermixing, and allows for much greater participation from external contributions without the same requirements for copyright consolidation as in dual licensing. The model has the intrinsic downside that the Free Software product must be valuable to be attractive for the users, i.e. it should not be reduced to ``crippleware'', yet at the same time should not cannibalize the proprietary product. This balance is difficult to achieve and maintain over time; also, if the software is of large interest, developers may try to complete the missing functionality in Free Software, thus reducing the attractiveness of the proprietary version and potentially giving rise to a full Free Software competitor that will not be limited in the same way.</li>
<li>Product specialists: companies that created or maintain a specific software project and use a Free Software license to distribute it. The main revenues are provided from services like training and consulting and follow the original ``best code here'' and ``best knowledge here'' of the original EUWG classification [DB 00]. It leverages the assumption, commonly held, that the most knowledgeable experts on a software are those who have developed it, and this way can provide services with a limited marketing effort, by leveraging the free redistribution of the code. The downside of the model is that there is a limited barrier of entry for potential competitors, as the only investment that is needed is in the acquisition of specific skills and expertise on the software itself.</li>
<li>Platform providers: companies that provide selection, support, integration and services on a set of projects, collectively forming a tested and verified platform. In this sense, even GNU/Linux distributions were classified as platforms; the interesting observation is that those distributions are licensed for a significant part under Free Software licenses to maximize external contributions, and leverage copyright protection to prevent outright copying but not ``cloning'' (the removal of copyrighted material like logos and trademark to create a new product)<a id="fnb-fn01" href="#fn-fn01" class="noteref">*1</a>. The main value proposition comes in the form of guaranteed quality, stability and reliability, and the certainty of support for business critical applications.</li>
</ul>
<div class="footnote" id="fn-fn01"><p class="footnote">[<a href="#fnb-fn01">*1</a>] Examples of Red Hat clones are CentOS and Oracle Linux.</p></div>
<ul>
<li>Selection/consulting companies: companies in this class are not strictly developers, but provide consulting and selection/ evaluation services on a wide range of projects, in a way that is close to the analyst role. These companies tend to have very limited impact on the communities, as the evaluation results and the evaluation process are usually a proprietary asset.</li>
<li>Aggregate support providers: companies that provide a one-stop support on several separate Free Software products, usually by directly employing developers or forwarding support requests to second-stage product specialists.</li>
<li>Legal certification and consulting: these companies do not provide any specific code activity, but provide support in checking license compliance, sometimes also providing coverage and insurance for legal attacks; some companies employ tools for verifying that code is not improperly reused across company boundaries or in an improper way.</li>
<li>Training and documentation: companies that offer courses, on-line and physical training, additional documentation or manuals. This is usually offered as part of a support contract, but recently several large scale training center networks started offering Free Software-specific courses.</li>
<li>R&amp;D cost sharing: A company or organization may need a new or improved version of a software package, and fund some consultant or software manufacturer to do the work. Later on, the resulting software is redistributed as Open Source to take advantage of the large pool of skilled developers who can debug and improve it. A good example is the Maemo platform, used by Nokia on its Mobile Internet Devices (like the N810); within Maemo, only 7.5% of the code is proprietary, with a reduction in costs estimated around 228M$ (and a reduction in time-to-market of one year). Another example is the Eclipse ecosystem, an integrated development environment (IDE) originally released as Free Software by IBM and later managed by the Eclipse Foundation. Many companies adopted Eclipse as a basis for their own product, and this way reduced the overall cost of creating a software product that provides in some way developer-oriented functionality. There is a large number of companies, universities and individuals that participate in the Eclipse ecosystem. As recently measured, IBM contributes around 46% of the project, with individuals accounting for 25%, and a large number of companies like Oracle, Borland, Actuate and many others with percentages that go from 1 to 7%. This is similar to the results obtained from analysis of the Linux kernel, and show that when there is a healthy and large ecosystem the shared work reduces engineering cost significantly; in [Gosh 06] it is estimated that it is possible to obtain savings in terms of software research and development of 36% through the use of Free Software; this is, in itself, the largest actual ``market'' for Free Software, as demonstrated by the fact that the majority of developers are using at least some Free Software within their own code (56.2%, as reported in [ED 05]). Another excellent example of ``coopetition'' among companies is the WebKit project, the HTML rendering engine that is at the basis of the Google Chrome browser, Apple Safari and is used in the majority of mobile devices. In the project, after an initial 1 year delay, the number of outside contributions start to become significant, and after a little more than 1 and a half years they surpass those performed by Apple by a substantial margin - thus reducing the maintenance costs and the engineering effort, thanks to the division of work among co-developers.</li>
<li>Indirect revenues: A company may decide to fund Free Software projects if those projects can create a significant revenue source for related products, not directly connected with source code or software. One of the most common cases is the writing of software needed to run hardware, for instance, operating system drivers for specific hardware. In fact, many hardware manufacturers are already distributing gratis software drivers. Some of them are already distributing some of their drivers (specially those for the Linux kernel) as Free Software. The loss-leader is a traditional commercial model, common also outside of the world of software; in this model, effort is invested in a FLOSS project to create or extend another market under different conditions. For example, hardware vendors invest in the development of software drivers for Free Software operating systems (like GNU/Linux) to extend the market of the hardware itself. Other ancillary models are for example those of the Mozilla foundation, which obtains a non-trivial amount of money from a search engine partnership with Google (an estimated 72M$ in 2006), while SourceForge/OSTG receives the majority of revenues from e-commerce sales of the affiliate ThinkGeek site.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some companies have more than one principal model, and thus are counted twice; in particular, most dual licensing companies are also selling support services, and thus are marked as both. Also, product specialists are counted only when there is a demonstrable participation of the company in the project as ``main committer''; otherwise, the number of specialists would be much greater, as some projects are the center of commercial support for many companies (good examples include OpenBravo or Zope).</p>
<p>Another relevant consideration is the fact that platform providers, while limited in number, tend to have a much larger revenue rate than both specialists or open core companies. Many researchers are trying to identify whether there is a more ``efficient'' model among all those surveyed; what we found is that the most probable future outcome will be a continuous shift across models, with a long-term consolidation of development consortia (like the Eclipse or Apache consortium) that provide strong legal infrastructure and development advantages, and product specialists that provide vertical offerings for specific markets.</p>

<h2><a id="h-5"></a>Conclusions</h2>
<p>FLOSS not only allows for sustainable, and even very large market presence (Red Hat is already quite close to 1B$ in annual revenues) but also many different models that are totally impossible with proprietary software. The fact that FLOSS is a non-rival good also facilitates cooperation between companies, both to increase the geographic base and to be able to engage large scale contracts that may require multiple competencies, both geographical (same product or service, different geographical areas); ``vertical'' (among products) or ``horizontal'' (among activities). This facilitation of new ecosystems is one of the reasons why FLOSS is now present in nearly all the IT infrastructures in the world, increasing value and helping companies and Public Administrations in reducing costs and collaborating together for better software.</p>
