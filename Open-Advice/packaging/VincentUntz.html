<p>\section*{A long time ago, in a room at night\ldots}</p>
<p>\noindent{}I took a last look at the list of bugs to see if I had not forgotten a patchthat should be merged. I made sure to write what I thought was a descriptive\texttt{NEWS} entry about the new version. I typed \texttt{make distcheck} tostart the release process and looked at the terminal displaying hundreds of lines.A tarball got created, and I double-checked that the tarball was building fine.Again and again -- I was anxious and somehow did not fully trust the\texttt{make distcheck} command. After checking everything several times, Iuploaded the tarball to the server and sent a mail announcement.</p>
<p>I had managed to do it: I had released my first tarball of a software of whichI had recently become co-maintainer. And I was certainly thinking: ``now userscan enjoy some goodness!'' But mere seconds after my tarball got uploaded, a fewpeople downloaded it and made my release really accessible to users.</p>
<p>This is something I took for granted, as I thought it was mostly a trivialtask. I thought wrong.</p>
<p>\section*{Upstream Versus Downstream}</p>
<p>As users, we do not necessarily understand the different steps required to shipsoftware to us. It is here, and we can simply enjoy it.</p>
<p>Many people contribute to this process of shipping software, and the effort isusually split between two groups of people, which are central in how FreeSoftware works today:</p>
<p>\begin{itemize}\item \textbf{upstream}: This is the group creating the software. It obviouslyincludes coders, but depending on the project, other categories of contributorsalso are key participants: designers, translators, documenters, testers, bugtriagers, etc. Upstream generally only ships the source code in a compressedarchive, a tarball.\item \textbf{downstream}: This is the group responsible for distributing thesoftware to the users. In the very same way as for upstream, contributors havea wide range of profiles, as they work on translations, documentation, testing,bug triage and more. There is however a profile that is, as of now, unique todownstream: the packagers, who prepare the software to make it available in aformat suitable for easier use than just source code, a package.\end{itemize}</p>
<p>Interestingly, this is a rather intuitive split for users too, although we areunaware of it: we often assume that the software developers are unreachable,and we send feedback and ask for help to the distributors instead.</p>
<p>A concrete analogy to clarify this upstream--downstream split could be theusual model for physical goods, with retail stores ($\approx$ downstream)distributing products of manufacturers ($\approx$ upstream), and playing animportant role for customers ($\approx$ users).</p>
<p>\section*{A Closer Look at Downstream}</p>
<p>If I had to summarize in one sentence the role of downstream, this is how Iwould describe it:\begin{quote}Downstream is the bridge between users and upstream.\end{quote}</p>
<p>When I released my first upstream tarball, I was assuming that for downstream,the work would mostly be compiling the source and building a package out of it,and nothing else. Building a package is indeed the first step, but this is onlythe beginning of the journey for downstream: then come several different tasks,some of which are purely technical while others are social. I will only verybriefly describe this journey here, in a non-exhaustive way, as this could be awhole part of this book\footnote{It is worth mentioning that I do not believethat downstream should significantly modify the software released by upstream;some downstreams do that, however, and this adds to their workload.}.</p>
<p>The building of the package itself can be less trivial than expected: it is notuncommon that the packager hits some issues that were unknown to upstream, likewhen a new version of the compiler is used (with new errors), or a specificlibrary needs to be updated first (because the tarball is using some new API),or the build system of the tarball is tailored for a specific way of working(which does not follow the guidelines of the targetted distribution). What iseven more ignored by many is that all those issues can also occur after thetarball has already been packaged, like when migrating the whole distributionto a new compiler or toolchain. None of those technical issues are extremelydifficult to handle per se, and upstream is often happy to help solve them; butwithout downstream, those issues could go unnoticed by upstream for a while.</p>
<p>What is more important to me than those technical challenges is that downstreamis generally in direct contact with more users than upstream. This results inbug reports, support requests, requests to change configuration defaults, andmore. This is where the downstream crowd really shines: instead of simplyforwarding all of this upstream, downstream will work on this feedback fromusers to only relay summarized bits that upstream will be able to use. Often,bug reports come without enough information on the issue (in which casedownstream will ask for more details); often, the support requests stem from amisunderstanding on the user side (which downstream can then, sometimes,translate to a suggestion to change the software to avoid suchmisunderstanding); often, new configuration defaults are suggested without agood-enough rationale (and downstream will work with the users to see if thereis a valid rationale). Of this huge amount of data, downstream will produce asmaller set of information that upstream will be able to easily consume, whichwill lead to improvements in the software.</p>
<p>There are generally two rewards for downstream contributors: the indirect anddirect contributions to the upstream project thanks to the efforts donedownstream are enough for many, but on top of that, the direct contact withmore users leads to being exposed to the satisfaction of those users. And suchexposure easily makes a day for many people.</p>
<p>As a sidenote, when considering the amount of work involved downstream, I wouldnot be surprised if, at the end of the day, many upstream contributors are gladto have downstream people act as a buffer to them: this significantly lowersthe amount of feedback, while at the same time improving the quality of thefeedback (by avoiding duplicated comments, undetailed issues, etc.). Thisenables upstream to stay focused on the development itself, instead of forcingupstream to either triage feedback or ignore it.</p>
<p>Just looking at my own upstream experience, I cannot count the number ofpatches I received from downstream to fix build issues. I also remembercountless discussions about the bugs that were affecting users the most, thathelped me organize my priorities. And since I joined the downstream ranks, Istarted sending similar build-related patches to upstream, and chatting with mydownstream hat to relay feedback from users. Such upstream--downstreamcollaboration contributes to improving the overall quality of our Free Softwareecosystem, and I would consider it essential to our good health.</p>
<p>\section*{Pushing Downstream Upstream!}</p>
<p>I am firmly believing that there must be a strong upstream--downstreamcollaboration for a project to succeed. I doubt there is much disagreement onthis by anyone; however, by ``downstream'', people usually think of the workbeing done in distributions. But, especially, for applications, it is becomingmore and more viable to push that downstream work out of distributions and toget benefits from such a move upstream.</p>
<p>Tools like the Open Build Service make it easy to have people build anddistribute packages of an application for several distributions. This hasbenefits for both the users (who can more easily and more quickly enjoy updatesof their favorite applications) and for upstream (who can help build a strongerrelationship with its user base). The only challenge with such a move is thatthere still needs to be someone doing the packaging work, but also to managethe larger feedback from users. That is, there still needs to be someone doingthe downstream work; except that it would be done as part of upstream.</p>
<p>To me, this sounds like an exciting perspective, and I would even go as far assuggesting that we, the Free Software community, should slowly migrate thedownstream work being done in distributions to be based on downstream workbeing done directly upstream whenever possible -- and at least forapplications, this is often possible. This obviously requires a mind shift, butit would allow more sharing of the efforts that are most of the time beingduplicated in all the different downstreams as of today.</p>
<p>For people willing to start contributing nowadays to applications they like,this packaging work upstream is a whole new approach that could be reallysuccessful!</p>
<p>\section*{I tried it and I stayed, will you?}</p>
<p>Downstream has always been essential to my life as a Free Software user --after all, only a few people are manually building their whole system fromscratch and I am not one of them. But it also became an asset to me as anupstream developer, as I started taking more time to discuss with downstreampeople to get more feedback on bugs, features, general quality and even futuredirections of the software I was working on.</p>
<p>This is only when I started being a downstream myself that I understood thatthis position is indeed a privileged one to help advise upstream, because ofthe direct contact to users and because of the different perspective we getfrom this different position.</p>
<p>Without downstream, we would not be where we are today. If you want to make adifference, be sure that by joining a downstream effort and talking toupstream, you will succeed.</p>
<p>And you will have fun.</p>
