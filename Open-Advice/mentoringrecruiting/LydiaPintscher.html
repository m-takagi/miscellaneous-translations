<p>Free Software has an enemy. It is not who most people on the Internet think itis. No, it is a lack of active participation.</p>
<p>Every single day there are thousands of people out there looking for a way toput meaning into their life, looking for ways to do something that trulymatters. Every single day thousands of lines of code for Free Software projectsare waiting to be written and debugged, programs are waiting to be promoted andtranslated, artwork is waiting to be created and much more. Sadly, far too oftenthe people fail to connect with projects. There are several reasons forthat. It starts with people not knowing about Free Software at all and itsbenefits and purpose. But we are getting there. People are starting to use andmaybe even understand Free Software on a large scale. Free Software projectslive by converting some of those users into active contributors. This is wherethe problems begin.</p>
<p>I have managed hundreds of students in mentoring programs and have been doingoutreach in various forms for Free Software projects. I've worked withenthusiastic people whose life was changed for the better by their contributionsto Free Software. But there is one theme I see over and over again and it breaksmy heart because I now know what talent we are missing out on: not being allowedto do awesome. It is best summarized by what a fellow Google Summer of Codementor said: &quot;The insight that most people in Open Source didn’t get allowed towork on stuff but just didn’t run fast enough at the right moment seems to berare&quot;. Potential contributors often think they are not allowed to contribute.The reasons for this are many and they are all misconceptions. The most commonmisconceptions in my experience are:</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;I can not write code. There can not possibly be a way for me to contribute.&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;I am not really good at this. My help is not needed.&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;I would just be a burden. They have more important things to worry about.&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;I am not needed. They must already have enough much more brilliant people than me.&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>Those are almost always false and I wish I had known a long time ago that theyare so prevalent. I would have done a lot of my initial outreach effortsdifferently.</p>
<p>The easiest way of getting someone out of this situation is to invitethem personally. &quot;That workshop we are doing? Oh yes, you shouldcome.&quot; &quot;That bug in the bug tracker? I'm sure you're the perfectperson to try to fix it.&quot; &quot;That press release we need to get done?It would be great if you could read over it and make sure it isgood.&quot; And if that is not possible, make sure that your outreachmaterial (you have some, right?) clearly states what kind of peopleyou are looking for and what you consider the basic requirements. Makesure to especially reach out to people outside your usual contributorbase because for them this barrier is even bigger. And unless youovercome that, you will only recruit who you are -- meaning you willget more contributors just like the ones you already have. People likethe people you already have are great, but think about all the othergreat people you are missing out on, who could bring new ideas andskills to your project.</p>
