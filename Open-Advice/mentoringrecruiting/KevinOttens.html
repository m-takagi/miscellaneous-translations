<p>Kévin Ottens is a long term hacker of the KDE community. He contributedto the KDE Platform at large, with a strong emphasis on API design andframeworks architecture. Graduating in 2007, he holds a PhD in computer sciencewhich led him to work particularly on ontologies engineering and multi-agentsystems. Kévin's job at KDAB includes developing research projects around KDEtechnologies. He still lives in Toulouse where he serves as part time teacher inhis former university.</p>

<h2><a id="h-1"></a>Introduction</h2>
<p>Free Culture communities are mostly driven by volunteer efforts. Alsomost of the people getting into such communities do so during their time at theuniversity. It is somewhat the right period of your life to embark in suchadventures: you are young, full of energy, curious, and probably want to changethe world to your image. That is really all that is needed for most volunteerwork.</p>
<p>But, at the same time, being a student does not necessarily leave you plenty oftime to engage with a Free Culture community. Indeed, most of these communitiesare rather large, and it can be frightening to contact them.</p>
<p>It obviously raises a scary question: do Free Culture communities, because theydon't try to actively outreach to universities, fail to attract the next generationof talented contributors?That is a valid question we tried to explore in the context of a communityproducing software, namely KDE. In this article, we focus on the aspects we didnot foresee but had to deal with while looking for an answer to this question.</p>

<h2><a id="h-2"></a>Building relationship with a local university</h2>
<p>Really, it all starts by reaching out to the students themselves, and for that,the best way is still to get to their universities, trying to show them howwelcoming Free Culture communities can be. To that effect, we built arelationship with the Paul Sabatier University in Toulouse -- more precisely oneof its courses of study named IUP ISI which focused on software engineering.</p>
<p>The IUP ISI was very oriented toward &quot;hands on&quot; knowledge, and as such had apre-existing program for student projects. A particularly interesting point ofthat program is the fact that students work in teams mixing students fromdifferent promotions. Third year and fourth year students get to collaborate ona common goal, which usually leads to teams of seven to ten students.</p>
<p>The first year of our experiment we hooked up with that program, proposing newtopics for the projects, focusing on software developed within the KDEcommunity. Henri Massié, director of the course of study, has been verywelcoming to the idea, and let us put the experiment in place. For that firstyear, we were allocated two slots for KDE related software projects.</p>
<p>To quickly build trust, we decided that year to provide a few guaranteesregarding the work of the students:</p>
<ul>
<li>to help the teachers have confidence in the topics covered: the chosenprojects were close to the topics taught at the IUP ISI (that is why wetargeted a UML modeling tool and a project management tool for that year);</li>
<li>to give maximum visibility to the teachers: we provided them a server onwhich the student production was regularly built and remotely accessible fortesting purpose;</li>
<li>to ease the engagement of the students with the community: themaintainers of the projects were appointed to play a &quot;customer&quot; role thuspushing requirements to the students and helping them find their way in theramifications of the community;</li>
<li>finally, to get the students going, we introduced a short course on howto develop with Qt and the frameworks produced by KDE;</li>
</ul>
<p>At the time of this writing, we have been through five years of such projects.Small adjustments to the organization have been done here and there, but most ofthe ideas behind it stayed the same. Most of the changes made were the result ofmore and more interest from the community willing to engage with students andof more and more freedom given to us in the topics we could cover in ourprojects.</p>
<p>Moreover, throughout those years the director gave us continuous support andencouragement, effectively allocating more slots for Free Culture communityprojects, proving that our integration strategy was right: building trust veryquickly is key to a relationship between a Free Culture community and auniversity.</p>

<h2><a id="h-3"></a>Realizing teaching is a two-way process</h2>
<p>During those years of building bridges between the KDE community and the IUP ISIcourse of study, we ended up in teaching positions to support the students intheir project related tasks. When you have never taught a classroomfull of students, you might still have this image of yourself sitting in aclassroom a few years ago. Indeed, most teachers were students once... sometimesnot even the type of very disciplined or attentive students. You were likelyhaving this feeling of drinking from a firehose: a teacher entering a room,getting in front of the students and delivering knowledge to you.</p>
<p>This stereotype is what most people keep in mind of their years as students andthe first time they get in a teaching situation they want to reproduce thatstereotype: coming with knowledge to deliver.</p>
<p>The good news is that nothing could be further from the truth than thisstereotype. The bad news is that if you try to reproduce it, you are very likelyto scare your students away and face nothing else than lack of motivation ontheir side to engage with the community. The image you give of yourself is thevery first thing they will remember of the community: the first time you get inthe classroom, to them \emph{you are} the community!</p>
<p>Not falling into the trap of this stereotype requires you to step back a bit and to realize what teaching is really about. It is not a one way process where onedelivers knowledge to students. We came to the conclusion that it is instead atwo-way process: you get to create a symbiotic relationship with your student.Both the students and the teacher have to leave the classroom with newknowledge. You get to deliver your expertise of course -- but to do so efficientlyyou have to adapt to the students' frame of reference all the time. It is a veryhumbling work.</p>
<p>Realizing that fact generates quite a few changes in the way you undertakeyour teaching:</p>
<ul>
<li>You will have to understand the culture of your students. They probablyhave a fairly different background from you and you will have to adapt yourdiscourse to them; for instance, the students we trained are all part of the so-called Y generation which exhibits fairly different traits regarding leadership, loyalty and trust than previous generations.</li>
<li>You will have to reassess your own expertise, since you will need toadapt your discourse to their culture. You will approach your own knowledge fromvery different angles than what you are used to, which will inevitably lead youto discoveries in fields you assumed you mastered.</li>
<li>Finally, you will have to build skills in presenting; a teachingposition is really about getting out of your comfort zone to present your ownknowledge while keeping it interesting and entertaining to your audience. Itwill make you a better presenter.</li>
</ul>
<p>As such, you will become a better teacher. Also your goals of getting welltrained students, and having students engage with a Free Culture community willbe better fulfilled.</p>

<h2><a id="h-4"></a>Conclusion</h2>
<p>At the end of the day why would you go through all the effortto build trust with a university and step outside of your comfort zone byimproving your teaching? Well, it really boils down to the initial question wetried to answer:</p>
<p><em>Do Free Culture communities fail to attract new contributors out of universities simply because of their inaction?</em></p>
<p>In our experience the answer is <em>yes</em>. Through those five years of buildingup a relationship with the IUP ISI, we retained around two students per year onaverage. Some of them disappeared after a while, but some of them become veryactive contributors. The other ones still keep some nostalgia of that period oftheir life and keep advocating even though they do not contribute directly. Andright now we have a local KDE team which managed to efficiently organize a twoday conference for our latest release party.</p>
<p>Of those former students, not a single one would have engaged with KDE withoutthose university projects. We would have completely missed those talents.Luckily, we have not been inactive.</p>
