<p>\noindent{}When I started to work in Free Software I was struck by the perceiveddifference between the ``community'' and the ``business'' stakeholders in this field.The informal assertion often aired at the time essentially proposed that there weredevelopers interested in hacking and there were commercial parties who would usetheir output in objectionable ways if not closely monitored. It was a generallybaseless assumption, and almost entirely limited to parties who identifiedthemselves as the community rather than those more aligned with businessinterests, but it was prevalent.</p>
<p>Despite being primarily associated with the community side of things, I resistedthe concept that there were two inherently hostile parties facing each otherdown over the future of Free Software. It sounded too simple to frame thedynamics of contribution, use and support as the interplay between noblecreators and devious freeloaders. Indeed, it sounded more like a situation wherecomplexity, change and uncertainty had lead to the creation of simplisticnarratives to provide comfort for parties moving out of their comfort zone. Icould feel the tension in the air, I could hear the arguments at booths and inmeetings, and I could observe the sharp comments or blowing off of steam atconferences. But what did it all mean?</p>
<p>Whether we were talking about Free Software project contribution, projectmanagement or license compliance, the relationships between stakeholders wereoften accompanied by assumptions, lack of communication and negative emotion.This in turn lead to greater complexity and a corresponding increase in thedifficulty of making unified decisions or resolving issues. I was aware that oneof the biggest challenges was how to build bridges between individuals, projectsand businesses, a necessary step to ensure common understanding andcross-communication of the rules, norms and reasons behind the licenses andother formal measures to govern this field, but that in itself does nottranslate into knowing how to engage with the issue effectively.</p>
<p>This was at the tipping point when GPLv3 was being drafted, Linux-basedtechnology was beginning to appear in all sorts of consumer electronics, andFree Software was at the brink of becoming mainstream. Change was in the air andbusiness investment around major Free Software projects was spiking. Suddenlythere were major corporation employees actually doing a lot of the difficultwork, there was significant funding available for events, and a lot of thesoftware stopped being about fun, and started to be about milestones,deliverables, quality assurance and usability.</p>
<p>This was probably a system shock to parties who had been doing Free Software fora long time. For much of its evolution Free Software was not just abouttechnical exploration and perfection, but also social interaction. It provided away for intelligent though occasionally awkward people to share a commoninterest, to challenge each other, and to cooperate inside carefully delineatedand predictable lines. Like stamp collecting, train spotting or Star Trek, itwas a place where detail-orientated people could converge, and it had theadditional benefit of providing broader feel-good social benefits as an output.It was not where the original contributors had expected to encountermiddle-management and output-orientated development focus. No wonder a few noseswere out of joint.</p>
<p>And yet\dots\ Everything worked out fine. Free Software is everywhere, andappears to be in an almost unassailable position as a mainstream component ofthe Information Technology industry. Projects like the Linux kernel or theApache server have continued to grow, to innovate and to attract newstakeholders, both commercial and non-commercial. The balance of power betweenindividuals, projects and businesses changed, occasionally with conflict anddisruption, but never at the cost of long-term cooperation or of undermining thecore value of Free Software.</p>
<p>From my perspective in the legal field -- which after all is merely a formallanguage that provides a context for interaction through mutually understood andenforceable rules -- the tension in Free Software did not lie in theintroduction of increased commercial activity, in the increased participation ofcompany employees in projects, or in change itself. The real problem lay in thegap between a displaced previous elite and their newer, occasionally verydifferent, fellow stakeholders.</p>
<p>The challenge was to create a level playing field where the different interestscould co-exist with mutual respect. Free Software needed to become a place whereinformation like the proper remit and obligations of a license or requirementsfor code submissions to a project could be obtained by any party at any time.Subjectivity and vagueness needed to take a backseat to allow the formation ofmore formalized transactions, which in turn act as an essential precursor forany large economic activity, especially in the context of an international orglobal community.</p>
<p>What had worked in the early days -- be it the trust of a few parties or thecommon understanding reached by a similar group with similar interests -- couldno longer act as social or economic drivers for the future of the field. Attimes this seemed like an insurmountable barrier and that the tensions betweenthe previous contributors to Free Software and new stakeholders must lead to acollapse of cooperation and perhaps of the progress made. But such a grimoutcome would presuppose conditions that simply did not exist.</p>
<p>Free Software provided a lot of value to different people and organizationsbased on some very simple concepts like the freedom to use, modify, improve andshare technology. These concepts allowed a great deal of flexibility, and aslong as people recognized their value and continued to respect them, challengesover secondary items like project governance or license gray areas were -- inthe long run -- pretty much irrelevant. The rest was mainly noise, the normalcommunication spike with all its trappings of drama that inevitably occurs whenone social group is joined by another. The same applies whether we are talkingabout a fishing spot, a country welcoming immigrants (or not), or two businessesmerging.</p>
<p>The changes in Free Software all looked a little confusing at the time, butessentially break down into three useful lessons that will be familiar tostudents of history or political science. Firstly, whenever there is an elite,it will seek to preserve its status and it will communicate the perceivedchallenge as a negative development in an attempt to undermine it. Secondly,despite the inherent tendency of any power base to be conservative, staticengagement with a changing field will only result in moving the opportunity forimprovement from existing parties to third parties. Finally, if something hasvalue, then challenges in governance are unlikely to undermine that value, butinstead will provide a method of refining both the governance mechanisms and thepeople in a position to apply them.</p>
<p>The development of Free Software as a mainstream technology saw increasedprofessionalization in both the approach of developers and in the management ofprojects. It also saw greater respect for licenses on the part of individuals,projects and companies. This was no bad thing, and despite a few rocky momentsalong the way -- you can take your pick from inter-community fighting, companiesdisregarding license terms or the upset caused by a move away from beer andt-shirt culture -- we are left with a stronger, more coherent and more valuablefield.</p>
