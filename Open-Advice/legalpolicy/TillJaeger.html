<p>\authorbio{Dr. Till Jaeger has been a partner at JBB Rechtsanwaelte since 2001. Heis a Certified Copyright and Media Law Attorney and advises large andmedium-sized IT businesses as well as government authorities and softwaredevelopers on matters involving contracts, licensing and online use. Oneparticular focus of his work is on the legal issues created by Free and OpenSource Software. He is co-founder of the Institute for Legal Aspects of Free \&amp;Open Source Software (ifrOSS). He provides advice on compliance with open source licenses and oncompatibility issues, and helps developers and software companies to enforcelicenses. Till represented the gpl-violations.org project in several lawsuits to enforcethe GPL and has published several articles and books related to legal questionsof Free and Open Source Software. He was a member of the Committee C in theGPLv3 drafting process.}</p>
<p>\noindent{}One thing upfront: I am not a geek. I never have been one, and have nointention of becoming one in the future.</p>
<p>Instead, I am a lawyer. Most people who read this book probably tend tosympathize more with geeks than with lawyers. Nevertheless, I do not want tohide this fact. That the FOSS community is not necessarily fond of lawyers butbusy developing software is something I \textit{did} know about FOSS in early1999 when our ways first crossed. But there were also quite a few things I didnot know.</p>
<p>In 1999, while completing my doctoral thesis that focused on a classicalcopyright topic, I was assessing the scope of moral rights. In this context Ispent a while pondering about the question of how moral rights of programmersare safeguarded by the GPL, which allows others to modify their programs. Thisis how I first got in contact with FOSS. At the time, ``free'' and ``open''certainly had different meanings, but the difference was not worth arguingabout in the world I was living in. However, since I was free to do what I wasinterested in and open to investigate new copyright questions, I soon found outthat the two words \textit{do} have something in common, that they are\textit{different} and yet they are best used together...</p>
<p>There are three things I wish I had known back then:</p>
<p>First, my technical knowledge, particularly in the field of software, wasinsufficient. Second, I did not really know the community and what mattered tothe people who were part of it. Last but not least, I did not know much aboutforeign jurisdictions back then. It would have been useful to know all that fromthe beginning.</p>
<p>Since that time, I have learned a fair bit, and just as the community is happyto share its achievements I am happy to share my lessons\footnote{The ``Institutf\&quot;ur Rechtsfragen der Freien und Open Source Software'' (Institute for LegalQuestions on Free and Open Source Software) offers, inter alia, a collection ofFOSS related literature and court decisions; see www.ifross.org for details.}:</p>
<p>\paragraph*{Technical knowledge}How is software architecture shaped? What is the technical structure of softwarelike? Which licenses are compatible with each other and which are not, and howand why? How is the Linux kernel structured?</p>
<p>To name one example, the important question of what constitutes a ``derivativework'' according to the GPL determines how the software may be licensed.Everything that counts as derived from GPL-licensed software must be distributedunder the GPL. To assess whether a certain software is a ``derivative work'' ornot requires profound technical understanding. The interaction of programmodules, linking, IPC, plugins, framework technology, header files and so ondetermines, among other criteria, whether a program is formally inseparable,which helps to determine whether it is derived from another program or not.</p>
<p>\paragraph*{Knowledge of the industry and the community}Besides these functionality issues I had no profound understanding of the ideabehind FOSS and the motivation of the developers and the companies that useFOSS. Neither did I really know about its philosophical background, nor was Ifamiliar with practical issues such as ``who is a maintainer?'' or ``how do version control systems work?'' In order to serve your clients best, these matters are no less important than your proficiency in technical aspects.Our clients ask us about legal aspects of forming business models such as duallicensing, ``open core'', support and services contracts, code development andcode contribution agreements. We consult clients concerning what FOSS might havein store for their companies or institutions. We also advise developers on whatthey can do about infringement of their copyrights, and draft and negotiatecontracts for them. In order to serve such clients comprehensively, it isimportant to be familiar with the different points of view.</p>
<p>\paragraph*{Comparative law knowledge}The third thing a FOSS lawyer needs is knowledge about foreign jurisdictions, atleast a few, and the more the better. In order to construe the differentlicenses, it is essential to be familiar with the perspective of the people whohave drafted it. In most cases the U.S. legal system is of key importance. Forexample, the GPL was drafted with U.S. legal concepts in mind. In the UnitedStates, ``distribution'' includes online distribution, whereas under the GermanCopyright system there is a distinction between offline and online distribution.Licenses that have been drafted by lawyers from the United States may thus beconstrued as including online distribution, which might be relevant and helpfulin court proceedings\footnote{\url{http://www.ifross.org/Fremdartikel/LGMuenchenUrteil.pdf}, Cf. Welte v. Skype, 2007}.</p>
<p>\section*{Always Learning}So, all this is useful to know. And as software keeps on being developed andmodified to provide solutions for the needs of the day, so my mind willhopefully keep on finding answers to the challenges the vibrant FOSS communityposes to a lawyer's mind.</p>
