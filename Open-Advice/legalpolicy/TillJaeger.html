<p>Dr. Till Jaegerは、2001年からJBB Rechtsanwaelteを共同経営している。著作権法やメディア関連が専門の弁護士で、中規模から大規模のIT企業や政府機関、そしてソフトウェア開発者たちに、契約やライセンスなどの助言をしている。中でも力を入れている活動が、フリー／オープンソースソフトウェアにかかわる法的な課題だ。彼はInstitute for Legal Aspects of Free &amp; Open Source Software (ifrOSS)の共同創業者だ。オープンソースライセンスへのコンプライアンスや互換性に関する問題への助言をしたり、開発者やソフトウェア企業がライセンスを守るよう手助けしたりしている。Tillはgpl-violations.orgプロジェクトにおけるいくつかの訴訟を担当し、GPLを守らせようとしている。また、フリー／オープンソースソフトウェアに関する法的な疑問についての記事や書籍を執筆している。彼はGPLv3ドラフトプロセスにおいてCommittee Cのメンバーだった。</p>

<p class="noindent">One thing upfront: I am not a geek. I never have been one, and have no intention of becoming one in the future.</p>
<p>Instead, I am a lawyer. Most people who read this book probably tend to sympathize more with geeks than with lawyers. Nevertheless, I do not want to hide this fact. That the FOSS community is not necessarily fond of lawyers but busy developing software is something I <i>did</i> know about FOSS in early 1999 when our ways first crossed. But there were also quite a few things I did not know.</p>
<p>In 1999, while completing my doctoral thesis that focused on a classical copyright topic, I was assessing the scope of moral rights. In this context I spent a while pondering about the question of how moral rights of programmers are safeguarded by the GPL, which allows others to modify their programs. This is how I first got in contact with FOSS. At the time, ``free'' and ``open'' certainly had different meanings, but the difference was not worth arguing about in the world I was living in. However, since I was free to do what I was interested in and open to investigate new copyright questions, I soon found out that the two words <i>do</i> have something in common, that they are <i>different</i> and yet they are best used together...</p>
<p>There are three things I wish I had known back then:</p>
<p>First, my technical knowledge, particularly in the field of software, was insufficient. Second, I did not really know the community and what mattered to the people who were part of it. Last but not least, I did not know much about foreign jurisdictions back then. It would have been useful to know all that from the beginning.</p>
<p>Since that time, I have learned a fair bit, and just as the community is happy to share its achievements I am happy to share my lessons<a href="#fn-f01">*1</a>:</p>
<div class="footnote"><p class="footnote">[<a id="fn-f01">*1</a>] The ``Institut für Rechtsfragen der Freien und Open Source Software'' (Institute for Legal Questions on Free and Open Source Software) offers, inter alia, a collection of FOSS related literature and court decisions; see www.ifross.org for details.</p></div>

<h3><a id="h-0-1"></a>Technical knowledge</h3>
<p>How is software architecture shaped? What is the technical structure of software like? Which licenses are compatible with each other and which are not, and how and why? How is the Linux kernel structured?</p>
<p>To name one example, the important question of what constitutes a ``derivative work'' according to the GPL determines how the software may be licensed. Everything that counts as derived from GPL-licensed software must be distributed under the GPL. To assess whether a certain software is a ``derivative work'' or not requires profound technical understanding. The interaction of program modules, linking, IPC, plugins, framework technology, header files and so on determines, among other criteria, whether a program is formally inseparable, which helps to determine whether it is derived from another program or not.</p>

<h3><a id="h-0-2"></a>Knowledge of the industry and the community</h3>
<p>Besides these functionality issues I had no profound understanding of the idea behind FOSS and the motivation of the developers and the companies that use FOSS. Neither did I really know about its philosophical background, nor was I familiar with practical issues such as ``who is a maintainer?'' or ``how do version control systems work?'' In order to serve your clients best, these matters are no less important than your proficiency in technical aspects. Our clients ask us about legal aspects of forming business models such as dual licensing, ``open core'', support and services contracts, code development and code contribution agreements. We consult clients concerning what FOSS might have in store for their companies or institutions. We also advise developers on what they can do about infringement of their copyrights, and draft and negotiate contracts for them. In order to serve such clients comprehensively, it is important to be familiar with the different points of view.</p>

<h3><a id="h-0-3"></a>Comparative law knowledge</h3>
<p>The third thing a FOSS lawyer needs is knowledge about foreign jurisdictions, at least a few, and the more the better. In order to construe the different licenses, it is essential to be familiar with the perspective of the people who have drafted it. In most cases the U.S. legal system is of key importance. For example, the GPL was drafted with U.S. legal concepts in mind. In the United States, ``distribution'' includes online distribution, whereas under the German Copyright system there is a distinction between offline and online distribution. Licenses that have been drafted by lawyers from the United States may thus be construed as including online distribution, which might be relevant and helpful in court proceedings<a href="#fn-f02">*2</a>.</p>

<h2><a id="h-1"></a>Always Learning</h2>
<p>So, all this is useful to know. And as software keeps on being developed and modified to provide solutions for the needs of the day, so my mind will hopefully keep on finding answers to the challenges the vibrant FOSS community poses to a lawyer's mind.</p>
