<p>Dave Nearyがフリーソフトウェア／オープンソースソフトウェアのプロジェクトに関わり始めたのは、彼がLinuxに出会った1996年のことだった。長年にわたってGNOMEやGIMPに貢献し続けている彼は、2007年以降はフルタイムでこれらのソフトウェアに関わっている。また、OpenWengoやMaemoそしてMeeGoといったプロジェクトにも参加しており、イベントを開催したりコミュニティを運営したり、プロダクト管理をしたりしている。また、ボランティアとして、さまざまなイベントの運営に強力している。GUADECやDesktop Summit、Libre Graphics Meeting、GIMP Conference、Ignite Lyon、Open World Forum、そしてMeeGo Conferenceなどだ。</p>
</div>
<p class="noindent">フリーソフトウェアのプロジェクトでは、コードを書く以外にもできることがある。中でも一番重要なのは、鍵となるコントリビューターたちを引き合わせることだ。</p>
<p>私は幸いにも、この10年間でいくつものイベントを運営することができた。また、他の人たちのやり方を見て、学んでもきた。これまでの経験で学んだことを、いくつか紹介しよう。</p>

<h2><a id="h-1"></a>会場</h2>
<p>カンファレンスなどのイベントを主催するときにまず考えることになるのは、会場だ。10人未満の小さな集まりなら話は早い。開催地を選び、そこで働いている友人だとか先生だとかに部屋を確保してもらえばそれでいい。ただ、規模が大きくなってくると、それなりにフォーマルな手続きが必要になる。</p>
<p>何も考えずに動いていると、会場代がかなり高くつくことになる。何とかして資金を捻出することを強いられるだろう。でも、頭を使えば、タダで使える会場を簡単に見つけられる。</p>
<p>こんな作戦を試してみよう。</p>
<ul>
<li>別のイベントと抱き合わせにする - Linux Foundation Collaboration SummitやOSCON、LinuxTag、GUADECなど多くのカンファレンスでは、少人数でのちょっとしたワークショップや集まりを併催できるようになっている。私が初めて主催した集まりは2004年のGIMP Developers Conferenceだった。開催地を決めたりみんなのスケジュールを調整したりといったことにわずらさされたくなかったので、GNOME Foundationに、GUADECの会場を間借りさせてもらえないか聞いてみた。答えはイエスだった。大規模なカンファレンスの運営チームをうまく活用すれば、大規模なカンファレンスにも同時に参加できるっていうおまけつきだ！</li>
<li>近所の大学の空き教室を借りる - そこそこの規模になってしまうとこの技は使えない。でも、地元のLinux User Group (LUG)に参加する教師のいるような大学なら特に、学部に頼んで講堂や教室を週末に貸してくれるかもしれない。たいていの大学では、そんなときにはプレスリリースを求めるだろうし、カンファレンスのサイトに会場提供のクレジットを掲載して欲しいとも言うだろう。まあ妥当な取引だ。最初のLibre Graphics Meetingはリヨン化学物理電子専門学校を無料で借りて開催したし、GNOME Boston Summitもこの数年ずっと、マサチューセッツ工科大学を無料で使わせていただいている。</li>
<li>タダで使える会場がなさそうなら、会場代を出してくれそうな人を探す。200人規模を超えると、タダで使える会場はほとんど見つからなくなる。カンファレンスの開催場所を提供するのにはコストがかかるし、大学にとってもそれは主要なビジネスモデルのひとつだ。でも、大学や会議場が場所を無料で貸してくれないからといって、必ずしもあなたが料金を支払う必要があるわけではない。地方自治体は、自分の地域内での大規模イベントに関わりたいと思うものだ。シュツットガルトでのGUADEC、Gran Canaria Desktop Summit、そして今年ベルリンで開かれたDesktop Summit。これらの開催場所に関する費用は、すべて地方自治体がまかなった。地方自治体の協力を得ることには、資金面以外のメリットもある。地方自治体は地元の企業やマスメディアとつながりを持っていることが多いので、それをうまく活用すれば広報活動もできるし、うまくすればカンファレンスに協賛してくれるかもしれない。</li>
<li>入札方式にする -- カンファレンスの開催を希望する都市による入札方式にすれば、開催地の確保だけでなく地元企業との事前調整などの様子も見てから行き先を決められる。それぞれ都市どうしで争わせるわけだ。オリンピックの招致合戦を見てもわかるように、みんな負けず嫌いだからね！</li>
</ul>

<h2><a id="h-2"></a>予算</h2>
<p>カンファレンスには金がかかる。小さめの集まりなら、主要なコストは参加者の交通費の支援ということになるだろう。大規模なカンファレンスになると、設備やスタッフそして会場に関する費用が主になる。</p>
<p>Every time I have been raising the budget for a conference, my rule of thumb has been simple:</p>
<ol>
<li>Decide how much money you need to put on the event</li>
<li>Fundraise until you reach that amount</li>
<li>Stop fundraising, and move on to other things</li>
</ol>
<p>Raising money is a tricky thing to do. You can literally spend all of your time doing it. At the end of the day, you have a conference to put on, and the amount of money in the budget is not the major concern of your attendees.</p>
<p>Remember, your primary goal is to get project participants together to advance the project. So getting the word out to prospective attendees, organizing accommodation, venue, talks, food and drinks, social activities and everything else people expect at an event is more important than raising money.</p>
<p>Of course, you need money to be able to do all the rest of that stuff, so finding sponsors, fixing sponsorship levels, and selling your conference is a necessary evil. But once you have reached the amount of money you need for the conference, you really do have better things to do with your time.</p>
<p>There are a few potential sources of funds to put on a conference -- I recommend a mix of all of these as the best way to raise your budget.</p>
<ul>
<li>Attendees -- While this is a controversial topic among manycommunities, I think it is completely valid to ask attendees tocontribute something to the costs of the conference. Attendees benefitfrom the facilities, the social events, and gain value from the conference.Some communities consider attendance at their annual event as a kind ofreward for services rendered, or an incentive to do good work in thecoming year, but I do not think that's a healthy way to look at it.There are a few ways for conference attendees to fund the running ofthe conference:<ul>
<li>Registration fees -- This is the most common way to get money fromconference attendees. Most community conferences ask for a token amountof fees. I have seen conferences ask for an entrance fee of 20 to 50 Euro,and most people have not had a problem paying this.A pre-paid fee also has an additional benefit of massively reducingno-shows among locals. People place more value on attending an eventthat costs them 10 Euro than one where they can get in for free, even if thecontent is the same.</li>
<li>Donations -- This is very successfully employed by FOSDEM. Attendees are offered an array of goodies, provided by sponsors (books, magazinesubscriptions, t-shirts) in return for a donation. But those who wantcan attend for free.</li>
<li>Selling merchandising -- Perhaps your community would be happierhosting a free conference, and selling plush toys, t-shirts, hoodies,mugs and other merchandising to make some money. Beware: in myexperience you can expect less from profits from merchandising salesthan you would get giving a free t-shirt to each attendee with aregistration fee.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Sponsors -- Media publications will typically agree to ``presssponsorship'' -- providing free ads for your conference in their printmagazine or website. If your conference is a registered non-profit whichcan accept tax-deductible donations, offer press sponsors the chance toinvoice you for the services and then make a separate sponsorship grantto cover the bill. The end result for you is identical, but it willallow the publication to write off the space they donate to you for tax.What you really want, though, are cash sponsorships. As the number ofFree Software projects and conferences has multiplied in recent years,the competition for sponsorship dollars has really heated up in recentyears. To maximize your chances of making your budget target, there area few things you can do.<ul>
<li>Conference brochure -- Think of your conference as a product you areselling. What does it stand for, how much attention does it get, howimportant is it to you, to your members, to the industry and beyond?What is the value proposition for the sponsor?You can sell a sponsorship package on three or four different grounds:perhaps conference attendees are a high-value target audience for thesponsor, perhaps (especially for smaller conferences) the attendeesare not what is important, it is the attention that the conference will getin the international press, or perhaps you are pitching to the companythat the conference is improving a piece of software that they depend on.Depending on the positioning of the conference, you can then make alist of potential sponsors. You should have a sponsorship brochure thatyou can send them, which will contain a description of the conference, asales pitch explaining why it is interesting for the company to sponsorit, potentially press clippings or quotes from past attendees saying howgreat the conference is, and finally the amount of money you are looking for.</li>
<li>Sponsorship levels -- These should be fixed based on the amount ofmoney you want to raise. You should figure on your biggest sponsorproviding somewhere between 30% and 40% of your total conference budgetfor a smaller conference. If you are lucky, and your conference gets alot of sponsors, that might be as low as 20%. Figure on a third as aball-park figure. That means if you have decided that you need 60,000 Eurothen you should set your cornerstone sponsor level at 20,000 Euro, and allthe other levels in consequence (say, 12,000 Euro for the second level and6,000 Euro for third level).For smaller conferences and meet-ups, the fundraising process might beslightly more informal, but you should still think of the entire processas a sales pitch.</li>
<li>Calendar -- Most companies have either a yearly or half-yearlybudget cycle. If you get your submission to the right person at theright time, then you could potentially have a much easier conversation.The best time to submit proposals for sponsorship of a conference in theSummer is around October or November of the year before, when companiesare finalizing their annual budget.If you miss this window, all is not lost, but any sponsorship you getwill be coming out of discretionary budgets, which tend to get spreadquite thin, and are guarded preciously by their owners. Alternatively,you might get a commitment to sponsor your July conference in May, atthe end of the first half budget process - which is quite late in the day.</li>
<li>Approaching the right people -- I am not going to teach anyone sales,but my personal secret to dealing with big organizations is to makefriends with people inside the organizations, and try to get a feel forwhere the budget might come from for my event. Your friend will probablynot be the person controlling the budget, but getting him or her onboard is your opportunity to have an advocate inside the organization,working to put your proposal in front of the eyes of the person who ownsthe budget.Big organizations can be a hard nut to crack, but Free Softwareprojects often have friends in high places. If you have seen the CTO orCEO of a Fortune 500 company talk about your project in a news article,do not hesitate to drop him or her a line mentioning that, and when the timecomes to fund that conference, a personal note asking who the bestperson to talk to will work wonders. Remember, your goal is not to sellto your personal contact, it is to turn her into an advocate to yourcause inside the organization, and create the opportunity to sell theconference to the budget owner later.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Also, remember when you are selling sponsorship packages that everythingwhich costs you money could potentially be part of a sponsorshippackage. Some companies will offer lanyards for attendees, or offer topay for a coffee break, or ice cream in the afternoon, or a socialevent. These are potentially valuable sponsorship opportunities and youshould be clear in your brochure about everything that is happening, andspecify a provisional budget for each of these events when you aredrafting your budget.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a id="h-3"></a>Content</h2>
<p>Conference content is the most important thing about a conference. Different events handle content differently -- some events invite a large proportion of their speakers, while others like GUADEC and OSCON invite proposals and choose talks to fill the spots.</p>
<p>The strategy you choose will depend largely on the nature of the event. If it is an event in its 10th year with an ever-increasing number of attendees, then a call for papers is great. If you are in your first year, and people really do not know what to make of the event, then setting the tone by inviting a number of speakers will do a great job of helping people know what you are aiming for.</p>
<p>For Ignite Lyon last year, I invited about 40% of the speakers for the first night (and often had to hassle them to put in a submission, and the remaining 60% came through a submission form. For the first Libre Graphics Meeting, apart from lightning talks, I think that I contacted every speaker first, except two people. Now that the event is in its 6th year, there is a call for proposals process which works quite well.</p>

<h2><a id="h-4"></a>Schedule</h2>
<p>It is hard to avoid putting talks in parallel which will appeal to the same people. Every single conference, you hear from people who wanted to attend talks which were on at the same time on similar topics.</p>
<p>My solution to conference scheduling is very low-tech, but works for me. Colored Post-it notes, with a different color for each theme, and an empty grid do the job fine. Write the talk titles one per Post-it, add any constraints you have for the speaker, and then fill in the grid.</p>
<p>Taking scheduling off the computer and into real objects makes it really easy to see when you have clashes, to swap talks as often as you like, and then to commit it to a web page when you are happy with it.</p>
<p>I used this technique successfully for GUADEC 2006<a href="#fn-f01">*1</a> and Ross Burton re-used it successfully in 2007<a href="#fn-f02">*2</a>.</p>

<h1><a id="h"></a>Parties</h1>
<p>Parties are a trade-off. You want everyone to have fun, and hanging out is a huge part of attending a conference. But morning attendance suffers after a party. Pity the poor community member who has to drag himself out of bed after three hours sleep to go and talk to four people at 9am after the party.</p>
<p>Some conferences have too many parties. It is great to have the opportunity to get drunk with friends every night. But it is not great to <i>actually</i> get drunk with friends every night. Remember the goal of the conference: you want to encourage the advancement of your project.</p>
<p>I encourage one biggish party, and one other smallish party, over the course of the week. Outside of that, people will still get together, and have a good time, but it will be on their dime, and that will keep everyone reasonable.</p>
<p>With a little imagination, you can come up with events that do not involve loud music and alcohol. Other types of social events can work just as well, and be even more fun.</p>
<p>At GUADEC we have had a football tournament for the last number of years. During the OpenWengo Summit in 2007, we brought people on a boat ride on the Seine and we went on a classic 19th century merry-go-round afterwards. Getting people eating together is another great way to create closer ties. I have very fond memories of group dinners at a number of conferences. At the annual KDE conference Akademy, there is typically a Big Day Out, where people get together for a picnic, some light outdoors activity, a boat ride, some sightseeing or something similar.</p>

<h2><a id="h-1"></a>Extra costs</h2>
<p>Watch out for those unforeseen costs! One conference I was involved in, where the venue was ``100% sponsored'' left us with a 20,000 Euro bill for labor and equipment costs. Yes, the venue had been sponsored, but setting up tables and chairs, and equipment rental of whiteboards, overhead projectors and so on, had not. At the end of the day, I estimate that we used about 60% of the equipment we paid for.</p>
<p>Conference venues are hugely expensive for everything they provide. Coffee breaks can cost up to 10 US Dollars per person for a coffee and a few biscuits, bottled water for speakers costs 5 US Dollars per bottle, and so on. Rental of an overhead projector and microphones for one room for one day can cost 300 Euro or more, depending on whether the venue insists that equipment be operated by their A/V guy or not.</p>
<p>When you are dealing with a commercial venue, be clear up-front about what you are paying for.</p>

<h2><a id="h-2"></a>On-site details</h2>
<p>I like conferences that take care of the little details. As a speaker, I like it when someone contacts me before the conference and says they will be presenting me, what would I like them to say? It is reassuring to know that when I arrive there will be a hands-free mic and someone who can help fit it.</p>
<p>Taking care of all of these details needs a gaggle of volunteers, and it needs someone organizing them beforehand and during the event. Spend a lot of time talking to the local staff, especially the audio/visual engineers.</p>
<p>In one conference, the A/V guy would switch manually to a screen-saver at the end of a presentation. We had a comical situation during a lightning talk session where after the first speaker, I switched presentations, and while the next presentation showed up on my laptop, we still had the screensaver on the big screen. No-one had talked to the A/V engineer to explain to him the format of the presentation! So we ended up with 4 Linux engineers looking at the laptop, checking connections and running various Xrandr incantations, trying to get the overhead projector working again! We eventually changed laptops, and the A/V engineer realized what the session was, and all went well after that -- most of the people involved ended up blaming my laptop.</p>
<p>Running a conference, or even a smaller meet-up, is time-consuming, and consists of a lot of detail work, much of which will never be noticed by attendees. I have not even dealt with things like banners and posters, graphic design, dealing with the press, or any of the other joys that come from organizing a conference.</p>
<p>The end result is massively rewarding, though. A study I did last year of the GNOME project showed that there is a massive project-wide boost in productivity just after our annual conference, and many of our community members cite the conference as the high point of their year.</p>
