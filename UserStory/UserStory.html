<p>User Stories are chunks of desired behavior of a software system. They are widely used in agile software approaches to divide up a large amount of functionality into smaller pieces for planning purposes. You also hear the same concept referred to as a <b>feature</b>, but the term &quot;story&quot; or &quot;user story&quot; has become prevalent in agile circles these days.</p>
<p>Kent Beck first introduced the term as part of Extreme Programming to encourage a more informal and conversational style of requirements elicitation than long written specifications. The essence of a story can be written on a single note card (Kent and I prefer 3&quot; by 5&quot;). Stories are deliberately not fleshed out in detail until they are ready to be developed, you only need enough understanding to allow prioritization with other stories.</p>
<p>Bill Wake came up with the <a href="http://xp123.com/articles/invest-in-good-stories-and-smart-tasks/" class="link">INVEST mnemonic</a> to describe the characteristics of good stories:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Independent</b>: the stories can be delivered in any order</li>
<li><b>Negotiable</b>: the details of what's in the story are co-created by the programmers and customer during development.</li>
<li><b>Valuable</b>: the functionality is seen as valuable by the customers or users of the software.</li>
<li><b>Estimable</b>: the programmers can come up with a reasonable estimate for building the story.</li>
<li><b>Small</b>: stories should be built in a small amount of time, usually a matter of person-days. Certainly you should be able to build several stories within one iteration.</li>
<li><b>Testable</b>: you should be able to write tests to verify the software for this story works correctly.</li>
</ul>
<p>A common way to formulate stories is the &quot;As a &#x2026; I want &#x2026; So that &#x2026;&quot; form. The &quot;As a&quot; clause refers to who wants the story, &quot;I want&quot; describes what the functionality is, &quot;so that&quot; describes why they want this functionality. The &quot;so that&quot; part provides important context to understand to help get from what the customer think they want to providing what they actually need.</p>
<p>Mike Cohn wrote what is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321205685" class="link">now the standard book on writing user stories</a>. To understand the roots of user stories in XP consider the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321278658" class="link">white book</a>, or the <a href="http://martinfowler.com/books/pxp.html" class="link">tasteful green book</a>. In an earlier bliki entry I discuss why <a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/UseCasesAndStories.html" class="link">UseCasesAndStories</a> are different.</p>
